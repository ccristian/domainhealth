Introduction
------------
DomainHealth is an open source "zero-config" monitoring tool for WebLogic. It
collects important server metrics over time, archives these into CSV files and
provides a simple web interface for viewing graphs of current and historical 
statistics.

DomainHealth is designed to provide administrators with a quick and easy way
to monitor a set WebLogic servers effectively. It is engineered to have a 
minimal performance impact on the managed servers in the domain.

DomainHealth also provides optional support for gathering statistics from 
another Weblogic deployed open-source project called WLHostMachineStats.
WLHostMachineStats is a small agent (JMX MBean) that runs in every WebLogic 
Server to collect O.S. statistics (ie. CPU/Memory/Network usage) from the host
machine. As a result, with the addition of WLHostMachineStats, DomainHealth
is able to show historical host machine graphs alongside graphs of regular
WebLogic Server statistics. For more information on WLHostMachineStats, see:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/wlhostmchnstats/

DomainHealth supports all WebLogic version from 9.0 to 12.1.x.



Quick Installation How To
-------------------------
   1. Navigate to this project's 'Download' page and download the J2EE web-
   application: domainhealth-nn.war
   2. Deploy domainhealth-nn.war to WebLogic 9.x/10.x targeted to the Admin 
   Server server of the domain only
   3. Using a Web Browser, navigate: http://adminhost:port/domainhealth
        (statistics may take a few minutes to appear - 
          keep pressing the Latest Time (right arrow) Button)

WARNING: If you have are replacing a previous version of DomainHealth on your
Admin Server, you MUST first undeploy the old version, then delete (or archive
off) the old 'statistics' directory containing the old recorded CSV files, then
deploy the new version. This is required because of changes to the CSV content
structure, for the new DomainHealth version, which is not backwards compatible
with older versions.

NOTE 1: If you need to change the path of directory where statistics CSV files
are written to, for the WebLogic start-up settings of the Admin Server (eg. in
setDomainEnv.sh), specify a JVM start-up parameter called 
'dh_stats_output_path' with a required value of the absolute or relative path 
of the root directory. For example: -Ddh_stats_output_path=/tmp/stats

NOTE 2: If your main WebLogic Admin user is not called 'weblogic', unpack the
'domainhealth-nn.war' web-app using an 'unzip' tool, and modify the
'run-as-role-assignment/run-as-principal-name' element value in the file
'WEB-INF/weblogic.xml' to the required WebLogic administrator name (eg. 
'system'). Then zip the 'domainhealth-nn.war' back-up again and deploy to the 
Admin Server.

NOTE 3: If on WebLogic 10.3 or greater, you need to prevent Domain Health from 
using WLDF to internally capture statistics and instead use JMX Polling (which
is the default on WebLogic versions less that 10.3), for the WebLogic start-up
settings of the Admin Server (eg. in startWebLogic.sh), specify a JVM start-up
parameter called 'dh_always_use_jmxpoll' with a value of 'true'. For example:
-Ddh_always_use_jmxpoll=true


Building From Source
--------------------
This project includes an Ant buildfile in the root directory to enable the 
project to be completely re-built from source and modified and enhanced where
necessary. The project also includes an Eclipse '.project' Project file, 
enabling developers to optionally use Eclipse to modify the source (just 
import DomainHealth as an existing project into Eclipse).

To re-build the project, first ensure the Java 1.5.x SDK and Ant 1.6+ is 
installed and their 'bin' directories are present in PATH environment 
variable, then check the values in the local.properties file in the project's
root directory to ensure this reflects your local WebLogic environment 
settings. 

Run the following commands to clean the project, compile the source code and 
build the WAR web-application:

 > ant clean
 > ant

OPTIONAL: To run the unit tests for the project, copy the JUnit archive ('
junit.jar') from this project's 'lib' directory into 'ANT_HOME/lib'm and then 
run:

 > ant test

OPTIONAL: To automatically deploy the generated WAR web-application to a 
running WebLogic Server, first modify the 'local.properties' file in the root 
of the project, to reflect the required WebLogic settings and then run:

 > ant deploy

To undeploy the application, run:

 > ant undeploy
